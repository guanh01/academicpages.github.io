title: "NLP-based Program Optimization and Synthesis"
role: "09/2016 - present"
excerpt: "<img src='/images/egeria.png' alt='Wootz Framework' style='width:500px;float:center'> <br />(Figure: A framework for automatic synthesis of HPC advising tools.)<br /><br /> Achieving high performance on computing systems is a complicated process. It requires a deep understanding of the underlying computing systems, the architectural properties, and proper implementations to take full advantage of the computing systems. In this project, we explore novel ideas to address problems in program optimization and synthesis by leveraging the recent progress in Natural Language Processing. 
<ul class='archive__item-excerpt'> 
	<li> Proposed a Natural Language Understanding-driven programming framework that automatically synthesizes code based on inputs expressed in natural language using no training examples. (Accepted in [FSE'20]) </li>  

	<li> Automatically synthesized advising tools for suggesting program optimization knowledge from HPC programming guides (CUDA, OpenCL, etc.); leveraged multiple NLP techniques including dependency parsing, semantic role labeling, TF-IDF and topic modeling.
