I am an Assistant Professor in the [College of Information and Computer Sciences (CICS)](https://www.cics.umass.edu/) at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, the flagship campus of the UMass system. I graduated with a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from [North Carolina State University](https://www.ece.ncsu.edu/) in 2020 (advisors: [Dr. Xipeng Shen](https://people.engr.ncsu.edu/xshen5/) and [Dr. Hamid Krim](https://www.ece.ncsu.edu/people/ahk/)). 

I work on machine learning and programming systems. I am a member of the [Programming Language and Systems at Massachusetts (PLASMA)](https://plasma-umass.org/) lab. 


Research
------
My research lies in the intersection between Machine Learning and Programming Systems: 
- Improving Machine Learning (e.g., speed, scalability, reliability) through innovations in algorithms and programming systems (e.g., compilers, runtime);
- Leveraging Machine Learning to improve High Performance Computing. 

I encourage all students interested in systems to attend the [systems lunch](https://emeryberger.com/systems-lunch/).
