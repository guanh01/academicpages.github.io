title: "Data Readiness Level"
role: "01/2014-09/2016: Research Assistant, NCSU."
excerpt: "Data nowadays are produced at an unprecedented rate; Cheap sensors, existing and synthesized datasets, the emerging internet of things, and especially social media, make the collection of vast and complicated datasets a relatively easy task. With limited time and human power, the ability to effectively harness the power of big data is a problem encountered by many companies and organizations. The project tries to ease the data understanding process by compressing and evaluating the valuable information contained in the data. Specifically,  
<ul class='archive__item-excerpt'>
	<li>Proposed a topological collapse-based unsupervised method for document summarization. The method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on standard datasets composed of scientific papers. (Published in [<a href='http://guanh01.github.io/files/2016spawc.pdf'>SPAWC'16</a>])  </li>

	<li> Proposed information-theoreticâ€”based metrics to measure relative richness/readiness of text data to answer specific questions; validated the metrics through a text-based experiment using Twitter data. (Available on [ <a href='http://guanh01.github.io/files/2017arxiv.pdf'>arXiv'17</a>])  </li>
