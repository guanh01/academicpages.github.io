title: "NLP-based Program Optimization and Synthesisg"
role: "09/2016 - present"
excerpt: "Achieving high performance on computing systems is a complicated process. It requires a deep understanding of the underlying computing systems, the architectural properties, and proper implementations to take a full advantage of the computing systems. In this project, we explores novel  ideas to address problems in program optimization and synthesis by leveraging the recent progress in Natural Language Processing. 
<ul class='archive__item-excerpt'> 
	<li> Automatically synthesized ASTMatcher expressions based on English descriptions of to-be-found code patterns by integrating natural language dependency analysis with ASTMatcher API types and domain knowledge.  This work is under review. </li>  

	<li> Automatically synthesized advising tools for suggesting program optimization knowledge from HPC programming guides (CUDA, OpenCL, etc.); leveraged multiple NLP techniques including dependency parsing, semantic role labeling, TF-IDF and topic modeling.
