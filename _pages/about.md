Hui Guan is an Assistant Professor in the [College of Information and Computer Sciences (CICS)](https://www.cics.umass.edu/) at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, the flagship campus of the UMass system. She graduated with a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from [North Carolina State University](https://www.ece.ncsu.edu/) in 2020 (advisors: [Dr. Xipeng Shen](https://people.engr.ncsu.edu/xshen5/) and [Dr. Hamid Krim](https://www.ece.ncsu.edu/people/ahk/)). Her research interest resides at the intersection of programming systems and machine learning, with a focus on improving the speed, scalability, and reliability of machine learning through innovations in algorithms and programming systems (e.g., compilers and runtime). Hui has been actively publishing in major venues in both programming systems and machine learning areas, such as PLDI, SC, ICDE, and NeurIPS. She was the receipt of the NCSU Electrical and Computer Engineering Outstanding Dissertation Award in 2020.
